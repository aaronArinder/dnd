Plan:

BEFORE THE GAME
  - Birdfriend found 8 leaves of an Athelas derivative, colloquially called Shadowbane
    - Heals shadow sickness
    - prepartaion: take three leaves, chew to make a salve


THE MORNING
  - the storm approaches in the middle of the night
  - nothing attacks
  - dawn breaks; the air is warmer, fresh
  - the trees seemed to have moved, though, as the path used
    to travel to the cabin can't be found
      - Birdfriend: tracking/survival check (13)(adv?)
        - if successful, easily find path
        - if unsuccessful, spend several hours looking, burning daylight

ON THE PATH
  - the lookout makes a perception check (14): spiders are following
      - success: knows they're being followed
      - failure: doesn't know
  - at night, they must make camp somewhere
  - 2 spiders attack!
  - a body found on the road; it's Odo's
    - has a broken bow, quiver of empty arrows
    - in his pocket, a simple silver ring

NOTES
two paths from cabin
weather warm for a few days
discovered webbing in the trees
take as much meat as possible: 40 days


HOW IT WENT DOWN
  - They wake up without incident; nothing attacked during the night
  - The trees have shifted, but Birdfriend easily finds the path back (rolled nat 20)
  - They're making their way on the path and Donaril notices a spider following them
  - The spider rushes toward them, Donaril nocks an arrow, shoots, and misses. He nocks another, shoots, and strikes the spider for 9 damage (of the spider's 23; so, now at 14)
  - During this, Birdfriend notices a bush farther to the south rustling; another bush closer then rustles, and so on. He nocks an arrow but doesn't fire. They don't yet know what it is that's attacking from the south.
  - Gimlet takes his two hand axes in hand, ready to fight.
  - Delph hides (I think?) behind a tree

NOTES FROM ACTUAL GAME
  - Donaril spent 2 arrows
