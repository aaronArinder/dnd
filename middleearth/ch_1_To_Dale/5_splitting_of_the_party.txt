During the fight with the spider, a rustling in the bushes to Birdfriend's left
alerted him to the arrival of some new foe. It turned out, though, that that new
foe was another dog, similar to Bird. Delph fired an arrow at it, thankfully missing,
and when the dog approached, it seemed friendly. It communicated with Bird, and then
led Birdfriend away to the south.

The party split up, with the others continuing their journey northward to Dale. They
ended up, after an uneventful day, at the Old Forest Road. There, they made camp.
During the night, a host of wargs came across their camp, passing it in the night.
They were headed south. As they passed, a chorus of wolfsong was picked up. It was
terrifying. This is where that part of the party left off.

Birdfriend met Rhadagast the Brown at Rhogsbol, and he invited him in to his hut to
'meet the others' (only the beginning of the scene was played out: three figures around a table
as Birdfriend was led in by Rhadaghast).

Notes:

Gimlet was drank the spider's blood, and his stomach churned slightly. He also took
a venomous pincer.
