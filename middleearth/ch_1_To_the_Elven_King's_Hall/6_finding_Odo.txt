The party traveled from the Old Forest Road to the Elf Path, and they made it their without incidenct. While traveling, there was a moment where Odo, the lost Woodman the barmaid from Woodmantown, could have cried out and alerted the party to his presence. He was under a dead goblin. About to cry out, his throat caught and he coughed instead. The party moved on.

After setting up camp, Donaril went on watch. He heard a frustated shout in the distance, woke both Gimlet and Delph, and took Delph to investigate. They discovered Odo under the goblin. They managed to pull the Goblin off of him, but not without Delph hurting his wrist. Odo's left leg is broken.

He told them that some goblins attacked him; he was saved by some dwarves, who chased off the goblins but didn't return.

They took him back to camp and put him to bed. They gave him some warg meat that had been cured with (I think?) healing herbs and some water. He was in and out of consciousness on the way back from the clearing they'd found him, and wasn't in fit shape for talking.
