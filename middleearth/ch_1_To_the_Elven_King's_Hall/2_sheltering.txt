Sheltering

Traveling west along edge of forest
Birdfriend was able to tell a large storm is approaching
  - about two days out
Attempted, and failed, to hunt rabbit
Made it to the shelter Birdfriend knew of
  - small, cold hunting cabin
Gimlet attempted to find firewood for the cabin's fireplace
  - went too deeply into the woods and was confronted by a wolf
    - others came to aid after hearing him scream
    - Donaril's arrow was the final blow, cleanly killing the beast
The wolf's body was taken back to the cabin, but, as they crossed the
  threshold, they heard a chorus of cries in the distance
They finally, successfully gather wood
They skin the wolf, dispose of the offal, and prepare the meat both for a
  stew and to smoke
