Preparing for the Storm

Donaril was the lookout during the night's rest and
  heard a rooting, snuffling noise around the cabin
  - looking out, he saw what appeared to be a dog's tail
    turning the corner
Waking up, the others, except Delph, decided to track what was prowling around
  the night before
  - with Birdfriend's tracking abilities, they discovered that 13
    wargs were headed east from their cabin. The group walked about
    an hour into the forest before turning around.
While the others were tracking, Delph begins smoking the meat from the previous
  night's kill
On the way back from tracking, Birdfriend noticed some spider's webbing
  - there was a fell stillness in the air
While the others were tracking what was prowling around, Delph searched
  through the cabin, finding a long dagger whose hilt is made of what
  appears to be silver, and whose handle and scabbard are wrapped in a
  blue leather
After returning, the group decides to weather the storm
  - they go about preparing themselves by gathering wood
  - they set up traps around the cabin to protect against wargs
    - three pits dug: west, north, and south of the cabin
    - five saplings bent as perimeter trip alarms
  - Birdfriend and Delph forage for useful herbs, finding some
The group ends by playing music together
