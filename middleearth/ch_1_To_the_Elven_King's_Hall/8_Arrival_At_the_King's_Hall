Delph made it back to camp after a short while of struggling in the woods. Donaril had called
out to him, and, after shouting into the darkness, saw something darker than the surrounding
darkness. After a moment, the patch consuming the surrounding night disappeared and all
seemed normal.

They spent a while discussing what to do with Odo, and in the end, they decided to take him. It
was hard going, but they made it to the Elven King's Hall.

They've begun a well-deserved rest, and will, after they spend time in a fellowship phase, continue
on to Dale.

Notes:
  - Delph took a shadow point from the interaction with the mirage-like shadow
