The day is clear, bright, and crisp in Sunnyvale, Massachusetts. It's early Fall, and two conspiracy theorists, Roger Thomas Mortan ('Rog') and Brad Torp, make their way out of a large outfitter's shop. Alphonse Joseph, a vain, plastic beauty, makes his way out of the ice cream shop. While crossing each other on the sidewalk, they notice a man who appears to be an older, wizened version of Billingsworth, the paper tycoon who disappeared 25 years ago after embezzling and running his paper mill into the ground (along with the town's local economy), leaving the ice cream shop Alphonse was just in. He was walking in the opposite direction, and so they made chase, but, falling over themselves, only got far enough to see a pale yellow Trebant pulling away from them.

At that moment, the tinkle of the ice cream shop's door bell rang again and _another_ man, looking simliar to the first (i.e., Colonel Sanders-esque), made his way in the opposite direction. Rog followed stealthily, and, just as the man let himself into a vacant shop (there's paper on the windows), he was able to get a good look at him. The others caught up and, pondering what to do, they heard a crashing noise and someone screaming.
