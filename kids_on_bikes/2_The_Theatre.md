Used Rog's lockpick set (prepared) to get into the shop. It was dusty, but a door in the back was cracked slightly. Rog went up to it to listen in and heard hushed voices. Brad asked Rog, "What's going on in there?" Meredith, the assistant to the assistant to the production manager, opened the door and shushed them, closing it after. The group was surprised. They went up to the door and Brad knocked, asking, "Hello? Is everyone alright?" (They had heard a crash and a scream the last session.)

Meredith opened the door again, she shushed them, and beckoned them in. As they eyes adjusted to the bright room, they saw people on a makeshift stage in tree costumes, with robed figures to the right of the stage, a piano to the left, the Colonol Sanders looking man standing in the middle of the room trying to direct everyone, and several people idling around, drinking coffee, and chatting softly. A choir began singing, and rehearsal continued on.

Brad asked Meredeth what was going on. She replied that they were rehearsing, and he told her that he needed to speak to someone about their door. She said she would go find the assistant to the production manager (being only the assistant to the assistant production manager), who would then talk to Thomas, the director who looks like Colonol Sanders.

During this, Alphonso stole some makeup. Some fancy foundation.

Thomas came over after a natural break in the rehearsal. They looked at the door, realized it was only lock-picked, and Thomas, unbothered and supremely bothered, stepped outside to smoke a cigarette. They asked him who he was, where he was wrong, and what was going on in the building. He's a professor at the local _college_, that he taught at the _University_ for several years prior (but these modern rules about how professors relate to their students forced him out), and that he's currently teaching at the local _college_. Theatre. He told them someone granted quite a hefty sum to the _college_ to put on a play about Billingsworth. That's why he's leading rehearsal in this dusty, cramped shop, with these musty, cramped people.

Need to figure out:
adversity tokens: how to spend to help each other (advantage?)
