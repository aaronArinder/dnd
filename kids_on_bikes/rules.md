### Stats & die
|stats|explanation|
|-----|-----------|
|Brains|This stat determines how book-smart a character is. This will determine how well they understand problems, how well they did or are doing in school, and how quickly they're able to solve academic problems.|
|Brawn|This stat determines how much brute strength a character has. It does not determine how well they can fight--just how well they can lift things up and how much physical damage they can take. It also determines how physically intimidating a character is.|
|Fight|This state determines how good a combatant a character is with whatever weapons or fighting skills you decide your character knows. While a character with a high Fight stat won't be able to pick up a gun and use it effectively if they have never fired one before, this tstat will make them good with eapons that they do have experience with. Also, they'll be able to learn how to use new weapons and fighting skills more easily, if given proper training.|
|Flight|This stat determines how fast a character is--as well as how skilled they are at evading their problems (both literally and figuratively). Characters with a high Flight stat will be fast and tough to trap both physically and verbally.|
|Charm|This stat determines how socially adept a character is and how good they are at reading the emotions of another person or group of people. Characters with a high Charm stat will be able to talk themselves out of tough situations and into good ones with relative ease--within reason.|
|Grit|This stat determines how hard it is to break a character emotionally or physically. Characters with a high Grit stat will be able to keep a level head in the worst of situations and will be able to keep their cool even when pushed hard. Finaly, this stat also determines how street-smart a character is.|

|die|explanation|
|---|-----------|
|d20|Supurb--Even upon first meeting you, anyone would be able to readily tell that this is a strength of yours. You are remarkably good with respect to this stat.|
|d12|Impressive--People who know you would say that you're pretty good with respect to this stat, but it wouldn't be something that's obvious during a first encounter.|
|d10|Above Average--You aren't remarkably good in terms of this stat, but you're slightly above average.|
|d8|Below Average--You aren't too bad in terms of this stat, but you're certainly not good, either. You're just slightly worse than average.|
|d6|Bad--People who know you would say that you're pretty bad with respect to this stat, but it wouldn't be something that's obvious during a first encounter.|
|d4|Terrible--Upon first meeting you, people would immediately be able to tell that this is a weakness of yours. You are remarkably bad with respect to this stat.|

|Skilled at __ (free for adults; available to teens and, at GM's discretion, to children)|Choose a skill (GM's discretion).
