Beggar Tyrant:
Moon colony of ritualistic cannibals. They live in a bunker and shoot a massive harpoon at
derelict ships to salvage what's on them. They recently acquired goats, but still practice
cannibalism. Some wear eyepatches with eyes painted on, for the darkness of their bunker
has, over time, given them a light sensitivity.
